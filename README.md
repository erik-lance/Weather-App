# Weather Application
A personal project to learn about GUIs and APIs.

## Description
This project simply fetches Weather Data through an API and displays it in a GUI. 
My API key is hidden. You will have to get your own API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

You can also use the `.env.template` and add your own API_KEY there so you don't have to re-type.
Simply fill in `API_KEY` then rename the file to `.env` and it should run fine.

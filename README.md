# Weather Application
A personal project to learn about GUIs and APIs.

## Description
This project simply fetches Weather Data through an API and displays it in a GUI. The user can search for a city and the application will display the current weather data for that city. The user can also save the city to a list of favorites and the application will display the weather data for all the cities in the list.
